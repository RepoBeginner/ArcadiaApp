# 1.1

## Bug fixes
- Changed Atari 7800 icon to the Atari 7800 controller

## Improvements
- Improved the iCloud Sync logic to only copy the data from the cloud, rather than using it as a source directly. This translates in better performances and less possibility to launch a game that is not actually downloaded (if you had no data for example)

# 1.0

Initial release
